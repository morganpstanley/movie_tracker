# Welcome to the Movie Tracker! 
This is a project I worked on for the Software Development Course at Flatiron. It uses a combination of Ruby and HTML to make a simple movie tracker where users have access to creating and editing movies that they may have in their collection. 

## Using the Movie Tracker
Because this is a school project and not a commerical one, the only way to access this app is to download it onto your own machine. Type 'shotgun' in the terminal, and visit the webpage mentioned.
